        <h1>Database Management System</h1>
        <img id="hero-img" src="images/dbms.png" alt="dbms hero image">
        <h2>DBMS</h2>
        <p>It is a software used to create, store and manipulate databases.</p>
        <hr>
        <h2>DATABASE</h2>
        <p>
            It is the information stored in an organised way so that it can be
            accessed and manipulated easily. We can create database through software or as hard copies with pen and paper in the form of tables, records etc.
        </p>
        <hr>
        <h2>Types of databases</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Relational databse</li>
            <li>Non-relational database</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Relational Database</h2>
        <p>In Relational Database, data is stored in the form of tables. It is a collection of data with predefined relationships. It is most popular form of data and widely used.<br><strong>Example:</strong> SQL</p>
        <h2>Non-relational Database</h2>
        <p>A non-relational database is a database that does not use the tabular schema of rows and columns found in most traditional database systems. It generally stores data in form of objects. <br><strong>Example:</strong> No SQL</p>
        <hr>
        <h2>Structured Query Language (SQL)</h2>
        <p>It is used to store and manage relational databases. It is the old and mature method. It includes table structure i.e. data is stored in the form of rows and columns. It becomes bulky in size. It is less flexible to changes. It requires schema i.e. what rows and columns will be required in future to create database and that can not be altered.<br><strong>Example:</strong> MySQL</p> <img src="images/mysql.png" alt="">

        <h2>Not Only Structured Query Language</h2>
        <p>It stores data in the form of objects. It is new and shiny method of storing data. It have document structure and is more flexible to change. We cant deal with complex relationships with it but it is easily scalable.<br><strong>Example:</strong> mongoDB</p><img src="images/mongodb.png" alt="">
